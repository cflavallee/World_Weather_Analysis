The purpose of this repository is to provide an example of how APIs, along with Python, Pandas, and Madplotlib (amoung other tools) can assist consumers with finding ideal travel locations based on weather preferences.  Then, we can provide them with weather information, hotel information, as well as a travel itinerary between cities.
